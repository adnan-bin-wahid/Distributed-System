You need to manually copy your updated smart-library-nginx.conf file from your project folder to the Nginx configuration directory on your system.

**Hereâ€™s what to do:**

1. **Copy the file to sites-available:**
```bash
sudo cp /home/iit/Desktop/IIT/6th_sem/601_Distributed_System/phase-3/Smart-Library/smart-library-nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/smart-library
```

2. **Enable the site by creating a symlink:**
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/smart-library /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

3. **(Optional) Remove the default site to avoid conflicts:**
```bash
sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

4. **Test the Nginx configuration:**
```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

5. **Reload Nginx to apply changes:**
```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

After these steps, your Nginx will use the config you created in your project folder. Let me know if you need help with any step!
